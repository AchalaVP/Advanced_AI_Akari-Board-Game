Akari Board Game CSP Simulation using Google OR Tools
This repository contains a simulation of the Akari board game implemented using Google OR Tools, a powerful optimization library. The simulation utilizes constraint satisfaction problem (CSP) techniques to model and solve Akari puzzles.

## What is Akari?

Akari is a logic-based board game where the objective is to illuminate all the empty cells on the board using a set of given light bulbs. The game is played on a rectangular grid, and each cell can either be empty or contain a numbered clue indicating the total number of light bulbs that should illuminate the adjacent cells.

## Features

- Constraint satisfaction problem (CSP) formulation of the Akari board game.
- Integration of Google OR Tools library for solving the CSP.
- Efficient search algorithms and constraint propagation techniques for finding valid solutions.
- Ability to generate solutions that satisfy all the constraints and illuminate all empty cells.
- Support for various puzzle sizes and complexities.
